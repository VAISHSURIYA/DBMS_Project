The Automated House Rental Management System streamlines the residential rental process using modern web technologies to connect landlords and tenants, facilitating property
management and simplifying rentals. It allows landlords to list properties with detailed descriptions, photos, and pricing, and provides a user-friendly search interface for 
tenants to find properties based on location, price range, and amenities. The system offers secure registration and login for landlords and tenants, along with profile 
management features. It streamlines the booking process, integrates a secure payment gateway for rent and deposits, and includes an in-app messaging system for direct 
communication and customer support. Landlords can manage property details, lease agreements, and tenant information, while tenants can report maintenance issues and tracktheir 
resolution. Additionally, landlords have access to a dashboard for monitoring rental income, occupancy rates, and maintenance expenses, along with reports and analytics for 
insights into market trends and performance metrics. Designed to be scalable and secure, this system ensures data privacy and protection, reduces administrative burdens for
landlords, enhances the rental experience for tenants, and promotes a more transparent and efficient rental market.
